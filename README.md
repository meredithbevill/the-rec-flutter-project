Welcome to the The Rec! This project was created as part of a university class to familiarize ourselves with Flutter, UI, and UX design principles. The app is specifically tailored to assist new gym enthusiasts in navigating the University Recreation (UREC) facilities at our university.

## Overview

The Rec simplifies the workout experience for users by providing tools to plan workouts, understand which muscle groups correspond to specific machines, navigate to machines within the UREC, connect with workout buddies sharing similar goals, and sign up for both local classes and sports activities within the UREC.

## Features

1. Workout Planning
Effortlessly plan workout routines tailored to personal fitness goals.

2. Muscle Group Guidance
Learn which muscle groups different machines target for a comprehensive workout plan.

3. Machine Locator
Locate specific workout machines or areas within the UREC facilities.

4. Buddy Connect
Connect with fellow gym-goers working on similar fitness goals for mutual support and motivation.

5. Class and Sports Registration
Sign up for fitness classes and sports activities hosted at UREC.
